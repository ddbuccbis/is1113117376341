 <strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong> <br>
 
Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications <br/>
and made available to customers over the Internet. SaaS is one of 3 main categories of cloud computing, <br/>
alongside infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a Service (PaaS).
<br/>
<strong>Benefits:</strong> <br/> <br/>

<strong>Flexible payments:</strong> <br/>
Rather than purchasing software to install, or additional hardware to support it, customers subscribe to a SaaS offering. <br/>
Transitioning costs to a recurring operating expense allows many businesses to have more <br/>
predictable budgeting. Users can also terminate SaaS offerings at any time.
<br/> <strong>Scalable usage:</strong> <br/>
Cloud services like SaaS offer high scalability, which gives customers <br/>
the option to access more, or fewer, services or features on-demand.
<br/> <strong>Automatic updates:</strong> <br/>
Rather than purchasing new software, customers can rely on a SaaS provider to automatically <br/>
perform updates. This reduces the problem of sourcing in-house IT staff.

    <strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong> <br/>
Cloud platform services, or Platform as a Service (PaaS), are used for applications, and other development, <br/>
while providing cloud components to software. What developers gain with PaaS is a framework they can build <br/>
upon to develop or customize applications. PaaS makes the development, testing, and deployment of <br/>
applications quick, simple, and cost-effective. With this technology, enterprise operations, or a third-party <br/>
 provider, can manage, virtualization, servers, storage, networking, and the PaaS software itself. <br/> <br/>
<strong>Benefits:</strong> <br/>
Enterprise PaaS provides line-of-business software developers a self-service portal for managing<br/>
computing infrastructure from centralized IT operations and the platforms that are installed on top of the hardware.<br/> <br/>

The enterprise PaaS can be delivered through a hybrid model that uses both public IaaS and <br/>
on-premise infrastructure or as a pure private PaaS that only uses the latter. <br/>

<div id="boxIaaS">
<strong>Information as a Service (IaaS)</strong> <br/>
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized <br/>
computing resources over the internet. IaaS is one of the three main categories of cloud <br/>
computing services, alongside software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).<br/>

<strong>Benefits:</strong> <br/><br/>
Organizations choose IaaS because it is often easier, faster and more cost-efficient to operate <br/>
a workload without having to buy, manage and support the underlying infrastructure. With IaaS, a business<br/>
can simply rent or lease that infrastructure from another business. <br/><br/>
In general, IaaS customers pay on a per use basis, typically by the hour, <br/> 
week or month. Some IaaS providers also charge customers based on <br/>
the amount of virtual machine space they use. This pay-as-you-go model<br/>
eliminates the capital expense of deploying in-house hardware and software.

<div id="boxCaaS">
<strong>Communications as a Service (CaaS)</strong><br/>

Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased <br/>
from a single vendor. Such communications can include voice over IP (VoIP or Internet telephony), <br/>
instant messaging (IM), collaboration and videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices.<br/>
CaaS has evolved along the same lines as Software as a Service (SaaS).<br/>
<strong>Bemefits:</strong><br/><br/>

CaaS offers flexibility and expandability that small and medium-sized business might not otherwise afford, <br/>
allowing for the addition of devices, modes or coverage on demand. The network capacity and feature set can <br/>
be changed from day to day if necessary so that functionality keeps pace with demand and resources are not wasted. <br/>
There is no risk of the system becoming obsolete and requiring periodic major upgrades or replacement.<br/> <br/>

Businesses have designed specific video conferencing products in which users can sign via the Internet <br/>
and participate as necessary. Vendors can then bill the business according to its participation. <br/>
The convenience and utility of CaaS and similar services are rapidly expanding the business world. <br/>
It is part of a greater trend toward cloud computing services and other remote services used by <br/>
businesses to reduce overhead or optimize business processes.
